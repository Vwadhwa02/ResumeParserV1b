Resume Parser V1 
A resume parser is a software program that is generally pre-installed with your Applicant Tracking System (ATS). It helps in analyzing a CV or data present in a cover letter and turns it into structured data. The parser extracts information such as contact details, work experience, education, skills, etc. from the resume and stores it in a structured format that can be easily searched and analyzed by recruiter
